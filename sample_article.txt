This Day-Date 40 is offered by a private collector in the United Kingdom.
A contemporary example of Rolex's premier dress watch, presented in full platinum with an ice-blue dial.
The seller is the first owner and purchased the watch from a Rolex authorised dealer.
Supplied with its XL display box, outer box and sleeve, guarantee card and manual, card holder, users manual, bezel protector and swing tags.
The watch is currently under Rolex’s five-year international warranty .
The vendor reports the watch to be in good working order.
Since its introduction in 1956, the Rolex Day-Date has become one of The Crown’s most iconic watches, and is seen as a symbol of luxury, prestige, and status the world over.
Crafted entirely from platinum, this hero reference features the sunburst ice-blue dial finished with applied roman numeral hour markers, only available on platinum models.
The watch features the signature ‘President’ bracelet, which is available almost exclusively on the Day-Date .
Beneath the platinum caseback beats Rolex’s calibre 3255, a chronometer-certified automatic movement with a 70-hour power reserve.
A screw-down twin-lock crown helps to deliver 100m of waterproofness, offering a level of versatility seldom seen from watches in this dress watch segment.
